# Would You Rather

This project is a React+Redux App that allows users to login and answer polls in the style of 'would you rather...' with two options to select from. Once a question has been answered the user is able to view the statistics for that question. It also functions somewhat as a game, points are awarded to the user for answering and asking questions.
